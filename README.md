Pliant Internship Assignment

Assignment #1 - Slice & Dice - Ghost Host
Slice the “Ghost Host” design layout using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. Here is a folder with all the assets.

Requirements:
●	The result should look the same as in the design in terms of layout and elements’ positioning.
●	The carousel in the “testimonials” section should be working - clicking on the dots should change the slide; if the user doesn’t change the slide for 5 seconds, switch to the next slide automatically.
●	The page should be responsive. It is up to you to decide how the page should look on mobile.
●	Use font-awesome library for all the icons that are not provided as assets
●	The images and icons can be different than the ones in the design.

Technologies:
Your page should use HTML, CSS and plain Javascript.
The use of external libraries is forbidden! (e.g. carousel libraries, bootstrap, etc.)

Criteria:
●	Correct layout matching the design
●	Carousel implementation
●	HTML5 and CSS3 correct use

Assignment #2 - Algo - Best Velocity
Team “Pliant Core” works following the SCRUM methodology. Their sprints are in a time interval of 2 weeks but they have issues finding out when they were most productive. Given the completed story points (results) from previous sprints, find the sequence of 3 consecutive sprints that gives the best total velocity of the team.

Requirements:
●	Write a script that accepts the results of the team as an input and outputs the sequence of the 3 consecutive sprints which have the best total velocity and the sum of the completed story points.
●	If the input contains less than 3 sprints, throw an error.
●	If there are more than 1 best sequence, output the last one.


Examples:
Example 1:
Input: [11, 14, 10, 12]
Output: { sequence: [14, 10, 12], sum: 36 }
Explanation: First sequence of 3 sprints is [11, 14, 10] - total sum = 35. Second sequence of 3 sprints is [14, 10, 12] - total sum - 36. Therefore, the second sequence is the best result of the team

Example 2:
Input: [12, 9, 1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: { sequence: [12, 9, 1], sum: 22 }

Example 3:
Input: [76, 80]
Output: error

Example 4:
Input: [76, 80, 81, 77, 83, 78, 80]
Output: [83, 78, 80]
